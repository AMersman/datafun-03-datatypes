List Transformations - Using filter() and map()

Small list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
The odd numbers from the list: [1, 3, 5, 7]
The odd numbers squared: [1, 9, 25, 49]
The squared numbers divided by cubed value: [1.0, 0.0123, 0.0016, 0.0004]

Lists 6. List Transformations - Using List Comprehension

Even numbers using list comprehension: [2, 4, 6, 8]
List values times 3 for even numbers: [6, 12, 18, 24]
Previous values divided by the max value in the list: [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
